His interest seems to lay mostly in investing. He has consistent spending habits, with very limited spending with few responsibilities (i.e. no car, children, hobbies, interests). He does have a decent amount of $$ to invest.
I've been clear that while we can talk about different ways to think about investments, I can not give him investment advice. We plan to meet again in a month to see what he has researched about long and short term ways of making investments with banks or credit unions.
My belief is that he already has the foundation and infrastructure that he needs and is financially sound. Likely we will close this relationship after we meet in a month.
